🧥 SideKick - Your Smart Outfit Buddy
Never struggle with "what to wear" again. SideKick is an AI-powered outfit generator that analyzes your wardrobe and the weather to suggest the perfect outfit for your day.

✨ Features
📸 Smart Wardrobe Management - Snap photos of your clothes and let AI catalog your wardrobe automatically

🌤️ Weather-Based Recommendations - Get outfit suggestions tailored to real-time temperature and weather conditions

🤖 AI-Powered Coordination - Intelligent style matching based on your available clothing

⚡ Quick Daily Outfits - No more morning outfit panic, just open the app and go

🚀 How It Works
Getting started is super simple. First, you take pictures of the clothes in your wardrobe. The AI recognizes what each item is and organizes everything for you.

When you open the app each morning, SideKick checks the current weather in your area. Then it puts together an outfit that actually makes sense for the temperature and conditions outside. No more freezing in a t-shirt or sweating in layers you don't need.
